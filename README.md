# Password Generator with JavaScript

## Description

I was given a password generator with full HTML and CSS. I was tasked with helping it function correctly by asking the user for specific password criterea.

- Password Length between 8 and 128 characters
- Do you want upppercase letters in your password?
- Do you want lowercase letters in your password?
- Do you want numbers in your password?
- Do you want symbols in your password?

Once all the questions are answered, the user is presented with a random password that is made available to copy and paste.
